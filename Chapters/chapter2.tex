\section[I love waves]{Section with an Unnecessarily Long Title}

This is place holder chapters and I need to get graphix in here and a bibliography going. This fell off from family puppeting..........SO HI I'M BACK. Didn't come here to make friends. I came here for being published in Nature and PhD and fellowships in Physics...so not here to be friends with the lady that drinks too much coffee and the man that eats too much fast food to have a heart attack...I want to go to the Olympics since if I keep working I can be a GOAT.
