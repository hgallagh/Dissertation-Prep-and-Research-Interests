\chapter{Started with Optics now we're here...I went to the dark side}

So I am very anxious and I want to type out everything that I need out of my brain in some sort of dissertation form because I am so anxious with UM just my family and my friends in general based on the fact that they are supportive but very doubtful of me so I mean like they're not doubtful but anytime I actually express the extreme version of what my dreams are I need to make sure that it goes through uhm and they would want me to relax or like being like oh just like it's gonna be OK just take a bath get some rest and I'm just like no my timeline is my timeline I'm sorry in advance that I'm not here to have coffee with you and I'm not here to go to your wedding that was not part of my plan my dreams are a PhD in physics I'm sorry if that's bad but this is how it's going right now in the middle of a pandemic so anyways I'm so far what I've been doing is uhm I transferred to RIT up at some point in my life and and I was doing optics UM ever since 2014 and I got my scholarship I got the cheaper tuition and everything and so while I was concurrently taking the institutional specific courses that I felt were not up at a high enough caliber for me I was teaching myself for a analysis and reading every research paper on optics and bioptics I mean polarization theory and then I was also doing research in astrophysics in the meantime so now I am almost done with the coursework for that on and I just am so anxious because I end up interacting with someone who did not transfer or did not have the same path as me because I worked in industry I made sure to do all these different things to make sure that I was skilled like I learn data science I learned this is that I learned in metal hydrodynamics in the general relativistic sense I carried on the textbook Carol and maybe rooting around everywhere and that is the truth like I listen to YouTube lectures while I fell asleep UM and I really did not have a social life uhm and I know that's surprising because of how I look up but that is the truth of the matter I actually spent time on this and I want to be compensated for it uhm so a man I want to be respected for it with the other men in my field but that's a whole another story I need to figure all of this out because a lot of times like I'm I'm reading or watching like something in terms of like OK like tomography like most of the time like I'm playing like the Russian roulette of like some occupied journal like I always say whatever you wanna call it it's up but it's been 10 like years of that up and so I've just been learning about like diffraction patterns and all of that so it's amazing how much I'm finally understanding all of that and I want to like continue and push forward with that but I do need my prosthetic brain for that kind of work up and I feel like my time is running out and that's like the whole point of like why I need to just get this out there UM and like I can edit all of it later UM it's just I need to do the brain dump now before I'm 26 because I feel like the longer I wait the less money I'll have less whatever and then I'll end up caving like everyone else who's just like getting married and everything and I just don't want that out of me so it's like I need to make sure that I get all this down and just be like oh I know a math I can like do this I can get out of this city on anything and I need to apply to grants I need to do all this and I just I can't stay in this town I I really just can't. What else do I know I know about lasers I love lasers like that is like a genuine love like not even like oh I want money from this is like no I actually enjoy the properties behind it and I like the science behind it up other than that UM I think that biology is interesting but that that's always the thing with like something like a dissertation or research is when you are talking to other people or collaborating with other people it's very common for them to like if specially if you are like the burnt out academic types such as myself up they will most likely deter you in some way to be like oh one step at a time it's like you don't know my academic history and you do not know the pressure I'm under to make sure that I just wrap this up somehow and I have no intention of wrapping it up up so that's always the issue uhm. I mean I was too anxious to even write A to do list for all of this like you just became too much so that's why I'm rambling or dissertation or whatever you want to talk about UM into this UM sheet UM I I want to do something on blue light and I am fully capable of like making some sort of diagram like I want to be in nature UM and I need to make sure that I talked to someone like doctor campanelli about all this UM and just figure this all out UM because I I need to do more with understanding like curvature and like something like the Ricci tensor like I need to do more with numerical relativity and they're like all of that and I need to do more of the readings but I have learned a lot about uhm I have gained I stream from all of this is at the very least a man how to talk like a nerd uhm I I've got that down I have the nerd hobbies and tendencies so I've got that going for me uhm other than that yeah black holes a black hole mergers church lots of chipan floor masses somehow I got here uhm I was sort of just doing math and throwing math and physics at the wall and throwing math and computation and whatever at the wall and somehow I was just applying it and somehow I'm here UM. Like I am a classic case of gifted kid burnout schitt uhm so i like chess i like learning japa....just need to make sure that i'm using and I'm realizing how much this is not a spectator sport and like the whole point is that I'm slowly getting up to the caliber that I wish to be at UM but in the meantime it's going to feel on not up to like it's gonna be subpar like before it gets better so that's just gonna be me talking about tensors UM and what are they they are multilinear maps for one thing that is the biggest thing and it's coming from like you first get introduced to like this idea of like dimensions and whatnot like OK like you start with scalars and then vectors and then you get into a linear algebra and like matrices and then you like slowly slowly get to bases and the vector spaces and then you get to tensors uhm because like it sensors help explain a non static universe because of fluctuating universe in a static universe are very different things and we're all just using some Monte Carlo random walk and everyone's just using the same coupled partial differential equations and everyone's just trying to like figure out the same thing so the people who are like your professors at like your random college are probably doing the same thing uhm and so you might as well just be going off in conducting the same research so long as you can do the derivations uhm then you're fine uhm except you should be in an institution because a lot of these things are expensive and the subscriptions are expensive so of course be doing that and you also want to be paid for it and so like you just keep on doing what you're doing and yeah fun. OK so other than that I of course I want to understand all these different packages like I'm interested in the Einstein toolkit I've been interested in the Einstein quote toolkit for several years now but like the projects that I've been working on have more vendors fancy base formula which is OK like it it's really OK but I do want to go on beyond that and I do need to understand like the different UM code composers and what not but OK like what kind of language is this UM so I just need to keep on going with that UM and like have more of a portfolio for my algorithms for it to be considered being like OK like is she like a PhD level is she had a post at level like what kind of grants can she get because if I'm operating at like what I would expect like a postdoc to do then I'm mind is like then it's like then lesson my options will be cut off so like I just need to be doing that kind of intensity up even if I'm not of course I'm not at that level like I know I'm not but I want to be aiming for that level because then I'll at least fall in like this range at the very least uhm and i only have so much time and i j....going to happen and so i just need to and I only have so much time and I just feel like the second I turn 26 like a lot of things that I wasn't planning on to happen are going to happen and so I just need to make sure that it's at least there.
