% This version of the thesis template has been updated for the February 2017 thesis guidelines provided by the School of Graduate and Advanced Studies by David Freund and Daryl DeFord. It was later further updated by Marek Svoboda on 12/25/2021 to conform to the latest update in the guidelines from 10/05/2021.

% Some good options are draft and singlespacing, for drafts, and *final*, for the final cut, and noheadings, for a printout without headings. You can also use the copyright option to add a copyright.  Note: final will enforce a bunch of different options, like oneside, 12pt and doublespacing, as well as make the margins correct. Draft has larger margins and is appropriate for twosided printing.

%%%%    IMPORTANT     %%%%%

%  Because dvips doesn't know/care about the page size of the dvi file its working on, and because its so important that the margins of your thesis are correct you have to make sure that you are using the command dvi -t letter *thesisnamehere*
%  If you are using a terminal this is straightforward, but if you are using a tex editing program it make take a little bit of searching before you figure out how to make this work.
%  Alternatively, you might consider compiling using pdflatex, which compiles straight to a PDF and doesn't have this problem.

Over the course of my academic and professional career I have reached many tests of my ability to continue on with my PhD in computational physics (the most general sense) 

\chapter*{Preface}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Preface}
Thank you to my parents. Thank you to my siblings, Emily and Ryan. Thank you to my UR friends and colleagues in Optics. Special mention to Austin, Woo, Zach, Tyler, Sze, Nick, Dr. Bently, Dr. Vamivakas, Dr. Alonso (probably doctors first, but Zach and Nick are probably going to be a doctor soon). Thank you to my RIT friends and colleagues in Astrophysics: Dr. Campanelli, Dr. Lousto, Dr. Reed, Dr. Rosato, (anyone that had to deal with me for RIFT), Dr. (Marko), Anjali, Jared.

\\ 
Thank you for giving me anger fuel: anyone that insinuates I'm dumb for being only this far with no phD and anyone that tells me I would be better suited in a project management role since I might struggle in a higher level course and anyone that hits on me or casts me in the romantic interest category while they do their career progression. \\ 

Think about the work you're aiming to do with your research and your ultimate contributions to society. \\


Thank you pandemic for giving me space from my current university. My old UR personality came back and I reconnected with people I have not talked to in years...also the pressure of maybe dying at any moment has me making sure that I dissertate as I was meant to do as my contribution to the field and society.  \\

The research proposals and course notes obviously will be omitted into another repository eventually, but at this point I'm demanding compensation or at the very least respect from my program for what I know not my ranking.
